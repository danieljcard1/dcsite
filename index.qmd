I'm an assistant professor in the [Department of Writing Studies](https://cla.umn.edu/writing-studies) at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, where I teach courses in technical communication and rhetoric.

My research focuses on the intersection of communication, digital technology and environments, and the production, documentation, and circulation of information.
