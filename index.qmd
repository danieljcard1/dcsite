I'm an assistant professor in the [Department of Writing Studies](https://cla.umn.edu/writing-studies) at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, where I teach courses in technical communication and rhetoric.

Broadly speaking, my research explores the complex relationship between communication, technology, and the production, documentation, and circulation of information.
